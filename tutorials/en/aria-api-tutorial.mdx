# Getting Started with Aria: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Rhymes AI's Multimodal API

## Introduction

Hello! Itâ€™s Tommy again, and today, Iâ€™m excited to guide you through an exploration of [Rhymes AIâ€™s](https://lablab.ai/tech/rhymes-ai) **Aria multimodal API**. This tutorial will explore Ariaâ€™s versatile capabilities for handling both text and images in various applications. Iâ€™ll guide you through setting up in Google Colab, making basic API calls, and using LangChain for advanced workflows. Youâ€™ll also find a link to a **Colab notebook** with all the code implemented for easy experimentation.

Whether you're a beginner looking to dip your toes into multimodal AI or someone curious about Ariaâ€™s capabilities, this tutorial will make it easy to understand and implement Ariaâ€™s features into your projects.

Letâ€™s unlock the potential of Aria together! ðŸš€

## Setting Up Your Environment in Google Colab

To get started, open a new Colab notebook, then install the required packages.

- **Install Required Libraries**:

  ```bash
  !pip install openai requests
  ```

- **Configure API Access**: Define the API base URL and your API key. Replace `'YOUR_ARIA_API_KEY'` with the API key obtained from your Rhymes AI dashboard.

  ```bash
  base_url = 'https://api.rhymes.ai/v1'
  api_key = 'YOUR_ARIA_API_KEY'  # Replace with your actual API key
  ```

## Interacting with the Aria API for Text and Image-Based Queries

With Ariaâ€™s powerful multimodal capabilities, letâ€™s start by interacting with its API, which can process both text and image queries seamlessly.

- **Initialize the OpenAI Client**:

  ```python
  from openai import OpenAI

  client = OpenAI(
      base_url=base_url,
      api_key=api_key
  )
  ```

- **Send a Prompt (Text Query)**: This example sends a query to Ariaâ€™s API and prints the response. Here, weâ€™re asking for a recipe suggestion, but you can customize it with any question.

  ```python
  response = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="Aria",
      messages=[
          {
              "role": "user",
              "content": [
                  {
                      "type": "text",
                      "text": "How can I make toothpaste?"
                  }
              ]
          }
      ],
      stream=False,
      temperature=1,
      max_tokens=1024,
      top_p=1
  )

  print(response.choices[0].message.content)
  ```

### Using Aria for Image-Based Analysis

Aria can also analyze images. To do this, weâ€™ll first convert an image to base64 format and then send it to Aria with a query about its content.

1. **Convert Image to Base64**:

   ```python
   import base64

   def image_to_base64(image_path):
       """
       Converts an image to a base64-encoded string.

       Args:
           image_path (str): The path to the image file.

       Returns:
           str: The base64-encoded string of the image.
       """
       try:
           with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
               base64_string = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode("utf-8")
           return base64_string
       except FileNotFoundError:
           return "Image file not found. Please check the path."
       except Exception as e:
           return f"An error occurred: {str(e)}"
   ```

2. **Send an Image Query**: Use the encoded image to interact with Ariaâ€™s image processing API.

   ```python
 base64_image_1 = image_to_base64('/path/to/image1')
base64_image_2 = image_to_base64('/path/to/image2')

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Aria",  # Model name updated
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image_1}"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image_2}"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "<image><image>\nWhat's in the image?"  # Added <image> symbols for each image
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    stream=False,
    temperature=1,
    max_tokens=1024,
    top_p=1
)

   print(response.choices[0].message.content)
   ```

## Advanced Integration Using LangChain-OpenAI

For more advanced workflows, we can use **LangChain-OpenAI** to manage more complex conversations with Aria.

1. **Install LangChain-OpenAI**:

   ```bash
   !pip install langchain_openai
   ```

2. **Initialize LangChain for Conversational Workflows**: Hereâ€™s an example where we create a math tutor bot, asking for step-by-step solutions to math problems.

   ```python
   from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
   from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

   chat = ChatOpenAI(
       model="Aria",
       api_key=api_key,
       base_url=base_url,
       streaming=False,
   )

   base = chat.invoke([
       SystemMessage(content="You are MathTutor, an AI designed to help students with math problems. Provide clear, step-by-step solutions and explanations."),
       HumanMessage(content="Hi tutor, can you help me solve this quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0?")
   ])
   print(base.content)
   ```

3. **Enable Real-Time Streaming (Optional)**: To get continuous output, try streaming responses. This is useful for live feedback.

   ```python
   # Uncomment to enable streaming
   # for chunk in chat.stream("Explain Newton's Third Law"):
   #    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
   ```

## Using cURL for API Requests (Alternative Method)

For those comfortable with cURL, hereâ€™s an example command to interact with Aria via the command line.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.rhymes.ai/v1/completions" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ARIA_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "model": "Aria",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": {"type": "text", "text": "How can I make toothpaste?"}}],
    "stream": false,
    "temperature": 1,
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "top_p": 1
}'
```
